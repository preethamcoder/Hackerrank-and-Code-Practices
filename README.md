# Hackerrank-And-Code-Practice
There are programs I tried to write in my early days of programming. They are all good sources for practice.
For some reason, MySQL is not being recognized as a language. I tried to override it in the .gitattributes section, but that does little to fix it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: It finally showed up as "SQL." Just took a while.
